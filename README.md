This repository contains artwork for the warau-project.

## Logo

The logo font is the font [Corporate Logo Medium](http://www.freejapanesefont.com/corporate-logo-font-download/
) using the kanji symbol **笑う** (warau, "laugh,smile"). [Pronounciation](http://de.forvo.com/word/%E7%AC%91%E3%81%86/#ja)
Around the kanji, there are three rounded rectangles that should roughly look like a photo-camera.

Spaces are inserted around the camera to take into account the cropping performed by services like TravisCI 
in their display.

The logo has been created and converted to png with `inkscape`.
