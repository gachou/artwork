This repository contains artwork for the gachou-project.

## Logo

The logo image is from http://www.clker.com/clipart-goose-9.html, a CC0 licensed image put into the right frame. 

The logo has been created and converted to png with `inkscape` version 0.9.1.

# Requirements

In order to build the artwork from its SVG files, you need

* `gnu-make`
* `imagemagick`

It probably doesn't run on Windows, sorry.
